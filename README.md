<h3><b>Space Challenge</b></h3>

In this project, you will build a simulation that will help us with our mission to Mars!

The mission is to send a list of items (Habitats, bunkers, food supplies, and rovers) to Mars, but we need to run some simulations first to pick the correct fleet of rockets.

We've already designed 2 rocket prototypes, but we need your help to design and run some simulations to help us decide which type to use.

<h3><b>U-1</b></h3>
The U-1 Rocket is light weight, agile and pretty safe, but can only carry a total of 18 tonnes of cargo. It costs $100 Million to build and weighs 10 tonnes. It has a slim chance of crashing while landing but a bigger chance of exploding when launching, both chances depend on the amount of cargo carried in the rocket.

<h3><b>U-2</b></h3>
The U2 Rocket heavier than the U-1 but much safer and can carry a lot more cargo; to a total of 29 tonnes. However, it costs $120 Million to build and weighs 18 tonnes. It has a greater chance of crashing while landing than while launching, but just like the U-1 both chances depend on the amount of cargo carried.
The Mission

The mission consists of 2 phases:

<b>Phase-1:</b><br />
This phase is meant to send building equipment and construction material to help build the colony. In the resources tab, you will find a text file that contains the list of all items that we need to send called 'Phase-1.txt`. Each line in the file contains the item name as well as its weight in Kgs.

The file is here.  <a href = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2017/December/5a372d67_phase-1/phase-1.txt"> Here </a>

<b>Phase-2:</b><br />
This phase is meant to send the colony of humans along with some food resources. In the resources tab, you will find a text file that contains the list of all items that we need to send called 'Phase-2.txt`. Each line in the file also contains the item name and its weight in Kgs.

The file is here.  <a href = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2017/December/5a372d88_phase-2/phase-2.txt"> Here </a>

Your job is to run some simulations and test both rocket types for each phase separately.
